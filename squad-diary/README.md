# Squad Diary
This is a space where students can anonymously share how they're feeling during their cohort. Go ahead and click on the add new entry link and head to the form to share your experience. Also you can share interesting topics you've discussed with your classmates during lunch. If you head over to the main list of submissions, you'll able to click on the "week #" link to see all of the posts for that specific week in the cohort.
